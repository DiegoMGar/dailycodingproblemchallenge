# Problem 8
## This problem was asked by Google.

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.  
Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.  
  
For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:  
```  
   0  
  / \  
 1   0  
    / \  
   1   0  
  / \  
 1   1  
```
